  description: | 
      ## Authentication
      To be specified by external API provider. Huf recommendation is minimum HTTP Basic Auth. A higher level of security can be achieved by using client certificates or auth tokens.
      ## Encrypted transport
      TLS 1.2 (or higher) is mandatory to use the API.
      ## Empty keyring
      After deletion of the last key of the user, an empty keyring is delivered with this event. This is needed to enable removing the last key also from the user's device.
      Empty keyring means the userLeaseTokenTable and the userSorcBlobTable hold zero elements.
