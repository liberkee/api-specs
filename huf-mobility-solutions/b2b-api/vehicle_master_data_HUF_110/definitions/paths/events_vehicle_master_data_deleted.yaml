      ## Master data deletion of commissioned vehicle
      Deleting master data of a commissioned results in a failure. Reason: if this would be done, there's no way anymore to decommission the vehicle, because it is not displayed anymore in the Service App. So before deletion, the client shall decommission the vehicle.
