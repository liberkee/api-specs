  summary: Notify that master data of a vehicle was added which shall be equipped with SixSense.
  description: | 
      ## Authentication
      Client certificate provided by Huf.
      ## Encrypted transport
      TLS 1.2 (or higher) is mandatory to use the API.
      ## Unknown externalVehicleRef
      Receiving this event with an unknown externalVehicleRef is not an error. As adding the master data of a vehicle is a pre-requisite for the mobile app based installation, it is a normal case that the externalVehicleRef is not known at this point.
      ## Field usage
      The Huf Service App will display at least the following fields for vehicle identification when available: vin, brand, model, modelYear.
      The additionalProperties are key value pairs, which can be used freely by the customer, but "name" keys are expected to be unique - system behavior is not guaranteed when the same "name" key appears more than once.
