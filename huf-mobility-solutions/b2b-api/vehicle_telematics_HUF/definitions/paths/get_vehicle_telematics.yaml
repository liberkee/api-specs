  summary: Retrieve latest vehicle telematics data (geo location).
  description: | 
      ## GeoJSON
      Vehicle positions are represented according to the GeoJSON format. The first two coordinate elements are longitude and latitude, or easting and northing, precisely in that order and using decimal numbers.
      Note that Google uses coordinates in reversed order.
      See RFC7946 for more details.
      ## Sigma
      Radius expressing the accuracy of the position information. Its unit is meters. The lower the value, the higher is the accuracy of the position.
      It is the sigma of the variance of the assumed normal distribution describing the uncertainty of the measured location,e.g. 68% of measurements are within this radius (in short: 'wobbliness').
      Absence of the Sigma field means it could not be determined for the given timestamp.
      ## Unknown position
      If no valid data for the vehicle's position is available, the position object in the response will not be present.
      ## SixSense Tracking privacy
      When the SixSense service "Tracking Privacy" is activated, no vehicle position is reported, when there is a valid digital key issued for the vehicle (i.e. it is potentially in use by an end-customer).
      ## "time" query parameter optional
      The "time" query parameter can be omitted, without it "now" is assumed and the latest values are returned. When it is given, the latest values *before* the given time are returned.
      ## Rate limiting
      This request is rate limited in a suitable way, to avoid performance problems due to excessive polling.
