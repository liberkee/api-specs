  summary: Trigger digital key creation for user & vehicle to access doors only
  description: | 
      ## Function
      This event shall be used to notify the Huf customer system of an access to a vehicle that was granted to a user (doors only). As a result, the Huf customer system will create or update the digital keyring for one or more users and provide them by sending one or more keyringUpdated events (see vehicle access EXTERNAL specification).
      The payload parameters of this event are managed by the customer and described in the model of the event body.
      ## vehicleAccessGrantId
      This ID shall be unique for every new access grant. When the same ID is used a second time, the system will return a failure.
      ## externalVehicleRef format
      There are GET routes in which the externalVehicleRef appears in the URL. Therefore, the externalVehicleRef must not contain special characters which are not allowed in URLs. Also the "/" character shall not be part of an externalVehicleRef, as it has semantics when it appears in a URL.
      ## Revoke
      To revoke the doors access, the common vehicleAccessRevoked event can be used. There is no separate "VehicleDoorsAccessRevoked" event.
  operationId: events - vehicle access granted doors only
