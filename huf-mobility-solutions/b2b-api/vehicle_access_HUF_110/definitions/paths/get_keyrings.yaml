  summary: Retrieve keyring for external user reference
  description: | 
      ## Authentication
      Client certificate provided by Huf.
      ## Encrypted transport
      TLS 1.2 (or higher) is mandatory to use the API.
      ## Unknown user reference
      For unknown user references, an empty keyring structure is returned. This is needed to enable removing the last key from the user's device. An empty keyring means the userLeaseTokenTable and the userSorcBlobTable hold zero elements.
      Error code 400 is returned when the externalUserRef is missing or empty in the request.
